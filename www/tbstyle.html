<h3>Toolbar Style Menu</h3>

<p>A web page designer, through use of the &lt;LINK REL="alternate stylesheet"&gt;
tag, can provide many different ways for the same page to be viewed.  Mozilla lets
you choose between those styles if you go to the View | Use Style menu.  But
you can't tell if a website actually provides
extra styles unless you click on the menu, which is a level deeper than
convenient.</p>
<p>I found that to be a pain, so I did something about it.  Toolbar Style Menu
(for lack of a better name) is a quick-and-dirty addition of a "Style" menu
onto the Link Toolbar (or Site Navigation Bar or whatever they're calling it
these days).  It disables itself when a web page doesn't support multiple styles,
and enables itself when it does, so I can tell right away that it's holding extra
styles for me to choose.</p>
<p><b><em>This is a quick hack.</em></b> I only made it for myself to use,
and so it's not
polished like TagZilla.  I provide it here in case anyone else can find a use for
it, but before you do, keep in mind that it may be buggy, or
behave in strange ways.  Please note that I made it to be used with the
Link Toolbar always visible,
since that's the way I use it.  I don't know how this will behave if you set your
own Link Toolbar to be visible "Only when needed".</p>

<h4>Note to Linux users</h4>
<p>If you installed Mozilla as <em>root</em>, <b>you must be <em>root</em></b>
to install this and other Mozilla extensions
at this time.  In addition, you have to <b>restart Mozilla as <em>root</em>
after you've installed TagZilla</b>, so it can update its chrome registry.  
<i>(That probably goes for other multi-user OSes too, but I don't know
which off the top of my head.)</i> If you installed Mozilla into your own home
directory, or another directory for which you have write access, this won't
be a problem for you.</p>

<h3>Uninstallation</h3>
<p>Neither Phoenix nor Mozilla currently provide an easy way to uninstall any extension XPIs
you may not like.  I recommend that you back up your chrome/ directory before you install
any XPI (whether TagZilla or otherwise), so you can "uninstall" it by restoring your
backup.</p>
