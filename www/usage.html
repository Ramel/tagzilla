<h5><a name="#invocation">Starting TagZilla</a></h5>
<p>TagZilla can be started from anywhere in Mozilla, using either of the following
methods:
</p><ul>
<li>From the <em>Window</em> menu</li>
<li>Using the TagZilla hotkey, <em>Ctrl-Shift-T</em></li>
</ul>
Starting it via either of these methods will bring up TagZilla in Clipboard Mode.
That is, whichever tagline you ultimately select will be copied to the clipboard.</p>

<p>TagZilla behaves slightly differently, if it's invoked from <em>within Composer</em>
using one of these methods:
</p><ul>
<li>From the <em>File</em> menu (Insert Tagline)</li>
<li>From the Composer <em>Context</em> menu (right-click, where available)</li>
<li>Automatically when sending a message <a href="#prefs">(see below)</a></li>
<li>Using the TagZilla Composer hotkey, <em>Ctrl-T</em><br>
<i>(Notice that this hotkey is <b>not</b> the same hotkey as used above!)</i></li>
<ul><p>
When TagZilla is started from within Composer, it works in (oddly enough) Composer
Mode.  This means that, when you finally select a tagline, it is automatically
tacked on to the end of your message. <i>(Note: it will be tacked on <em>after</em> the
signature placed there by Mozilla, if you use one.)</i></p>

<h5><a name="#basics">Basic Usage</a></h5>
<p>When you start TagZilla, it will open a file picker, where you can choose a
tagline file to use (unless you specified a default tagline file in the
<a href="#prefs">TagZilla Preferences</a>).  A tagline file is just a text file
containing one tagline per line.</p>

<p>The TagZilla Window is pretty self-explanatory, but here's a quick tour.
At the top of the window, front and centre, is the tagline text box.  <em>Whatever
text appears here</em> is what will be selected as your tagline, regardless of whatever
is or isn't selected in the list beneath it.  That list beneath the text box is
a complete list of the taglines in the file you selected.  To select one, simply
click on it.  Edit it in the text box, if you like, then click <em>Insert</em> (in
Composer Mode) or <em>Copy to Clipboard</em> (in Clipboard Mode).  The tagline will
be grabbed and TagZilla will close.  (To exit TagZilla without grabbing a tagline,
use the <em>Close</em> button.)</p>

<p>If you select the Insert or Copy to Clipboard button and there's no tagline in
the text box, a random tagline is selected and grabbed before TagZilla is closed.
This is handy if you don't feel like choosing a tagline.  Be warned that you will
<em>not</em> be given the opportunity to edit this tagline before TagZilla closes!
If you don't feel like taking that risk, click the
<img src="tz-rand.png" width="16" height="16" alt="T?"> <em>Random Tagline</em>
button, discussed <a href="#list">below</a>.</p>

<h5><a name="#list">Tagline Management</a></h5>

<p>To the left of the text box are four useful buttons:
</p><ul>
<li><img src="tz-rand.png" width="16" height="16" alt="T?"> <em>Select</em> a random
tagline.</li>
<li><img src="tz-add.png" width="16" height="16" alt="T+"> Add the currently
<em>entered</em> tagline to the tagline list.</li>
<li><img src="tz-mod.png" width="16" height="16" alt="TT"> Replace the currently
<em>selected</em> tagline in the list with the currently <em>entered</em> tagline.</li>
<li><img src="tz-del.png" width="16" height="16" alt="T-"> Delete the currently
<em>selected</em> tagline from the list.  Multiple taglines may be selected at once
for deletion.</li>
</ul>
Remember that the tagline currently <em>entered</em> in the text box is the one
that will be grabbed when you exit TagZilla.</p>
<p>At the top of the window is the <em>List</em> menu.  It has three useful options:
<em>Load List</em>, <em>Save List</em>, and <em>Sort List</em>.  Their functions
are self-explanatory.  However, be warned that <em>sorting a long list can take
a long time</em>.</p>

<h5><a name="#prefs">TagZilla Preferences</a></h5>
<p>TagZilla has two preference panels.  These can be accessed by the Preferences
button within TagZilla, or elsewhere in Mozilla by <em>Edit | Preferences</em>.</p>
<p>The main TagZilla pref panel has the following settings:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Default tagline file.</b> The path to the tagline file you want loaded
when TagZilla starts up.  Set it to blank to be prompted each time.</li>
<li><b>Set this default to the last loaded tagline file.</b> When TagZilla closes,
whichever file is currently open will be used as the default tagline file
for the next time TagZilla starts, unless you clear this checkbox.</li>
<li><b>Automatically open TagZilla on Message Send.</b> Through the magic of overlays,
TagZilla can be started automatically when you try to send a mail message.  To
prevent this behaviour, clear this checkbox.</li>
</ul><p>
<p>The Formatting pref panel lets you choose how your tagline will appear when you
use it.  Type in one prefix and suffix to surround your tagline when it's inserted
in Composer, and another for when it's copied to the clipboard.  The text boxes
at the bottom of the pref panel show you how it will look.</p>
<p>Note that entering "\n" will insert a carriage return in both Composer <em>and</em>
in the clipboard.</p>
