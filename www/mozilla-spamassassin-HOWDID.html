<a class="h3" name="intro" href="#toc">Introduction</a>
<p>This document aims to describe how I combined the stealth ninja goodness of
<a href="http://spamassassin.org/">SpamAssassin</a> with the sweet sugar-coated
UI of <a href="http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> Mail.  It's not intended to be
a set of instructions (that would be a
<a href="http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto">HOWTO</a>), but a record of what I
did, that perhaps you can learn from.  If you try anything you read here, you're
doing it at your own risk; I hereby accept absolutely <b>no</b> responsibility
for whatever you do to your computer.</p>

<a class="h3" name="start" href="#toc">Starting Point</a>
<p>Here is what I started off with:</p><ul>
<li>A Pentium-III computer, running at 666MHz (no kidding)</li>
<li>A reasonably fresh (less than one month old) install of
<a href="http://redhat.com/">RedHat Linux 8.0</a></li>
<li>An intermediate-to-advanced knowledge of how a Linux system works</li>
<li>A fresh install of <a href="http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla 1.2 beta</a></li>
<li>A dial-up internet connection</li>
<li>Two email addresses, both accessible via POP3, which I wanted SpamAssassin to
work on</li>
</ul>

<p>The first step I took in this direction was to beg and plead for guidance from
someone who had been there and done that, namely Mark Smitka.  He very graciously
shared his experiences with me.  I didn't follow them to the letter for a few reasons,
mainly because it required a bit too much stuff to happen as root user for my comfort.
But it was still very useful.  Here it is:</p>

It turns out, I documented the process.  I can't swear it's without errors, or 
complete in every respect, but between that and the SpamAssassin site, it's 
at least a head start.  Info below:
--
SpamAssassin Configuration for Linux


This procedure documents the configuration of SpamAssassin, fetchmail, and 
Kmail. When complete, POP3 mail will be retrieved by from the remote server 
by fetchmail, processed through SpamAssassin, and then passed to and filtered 
appropriately by Kmail. 

(Note: This document assumes the system is running Redhat Linux 8.0, but I 
suspect all Linux configurations are similar, if not the same. It is also 
assumed that you will be setting up SpamAssassin to run via the root user 
account.)

 The Redhat Linux 8.0 distribution includes SpamAssassin, and it should have 
been installed when the OS was first loaded. If not, it should be installed 
via the RPM package manager. The instructions that follow are based on an 
already installed version of SpamAssassin, and do not include the steps 
required to compile that application.
 Copy the SpamAssassin folder found under '/usr/share/spamassassin' to 
'/root/spamassassin'. Also be sure that within the root directory is a hidden 
directory named .spamassassin, and that there is a file within named 
'user_prefs'.  This may be auto-created by SpamAssassin after the first 
test/execution, so if it's not there just yet, check again after the test 
process below.
>From the KDE menu, choose "Server Settings | Services", and start the 
SpamAssassin service, if it is not already running.
Within the root directory, create a file (if it doesn't already exist) named 
'.procmailrc'. Using a text editor, paste or enter the following lines:
 
:0fw
| /usr/bin/spamassassin
     
(Note:Be sure that the above file (and others you will create below) contain 
one <CR> at the end of the last line.)

For testing purposes, create a file named 'sample-nonspam.txt' in the root 
directory. It should be formatted as a standard RFC compliant e-mail message, 
or at least close enough so as not to trigger SpamAssassin's threshold. My 
sample message looks like this:

From: Mark Geekmaster <myaddress@mydomain.com>
To: Joe User <j.user@anywhere.net>
Date: Wed, 08 Oct 2002 21:16:39 -0400
Subject: A Safe Test

This is sample safe text message. How is everything going?

Mark
(Note: The "To" and "From" addresses should not be the same in the 
nonspam.txt, as this will trigger a SpamAssassin rule)

For testing purposes, create a file named 'sample-spam.txt'. It should break 
enough SpamAssassin rules to trigger the default threshold, which is a 5 
point total. My sample message looks like this:

From: Mark Geekmaster <myaddress@mydomain.com>
To: Mark Geekmaster <myaddress@mydomain.com>
Date: 10/08/2002
Subject: Stock opt-in offer

This is a viagra text message. How is everything going?

Mark

(Note: The "To" and "From" addresses are the same, the date header is 
incorrect, and there are keywords in the "Subject" and body that should 
trigger the SpamAssassin threshold)

Test SpamAssassin with the following commands entered via command-line as 
root:

spamassassin -t < sample-nonspam.txt > nonspam.out
spamassassin -t < sample-spam.txt > spam.out

Verify (using a text viewer, ie. "less" or "notepad") that nonspam.out has not 
been tagged as spam, and that spam.out has.  The files should contain the 
full text and headers of the messages, the "spam.out" message should be 
annotated with "****SPAM****" in the subject line and a report from 
SpamAssassin, and there should be no errors when you run the commands.
Even though sample-nonspam.txt is not spam, nonspam.out will contain a 
SpamAssassin report anyway.  This is a side-effect of the "-t" (test) switch.  
However, there should be less than 5 hits accumulated; when the "-t" switch 
is not in use, the report text would not be added.

(Note: If the commands do not work, DO NOT PROCEED TO THE NEXT STEP, as you 
will lose mail!)
Now, if all is well, you'll most likely want to retrieve your POP mail from a 
remote server, from one or more accounts, and have it passed to KDE mail 
after being analyzed by SpamAssassin.  It is the fetchmail process that will 
retrieve the mail from the POP server(s), and needs to be configured for your 
account(s).
Place a file named '.fetchmailrc' in the root directory. In it, format the 
account parameters as below:

poll mail.server.com with protocol pop3
user username, with password yourpassword

Repeat the above set of lines for each account that you want polled.
Since you most likely do not want to manually type fetchmail whenever you want 
your mail checked, we'll run fetchmail as a daemon process at system startup. 
It will run as root, and include logging. To accomplish this, you'll edit the 
file '/etc/rc.d/rc.local, and will include the following lines (customized as 
you like of course):

HOME=/root
/usr/bin/fetchmail -a -v -d 600 -L /root/fetchmail.log

The parameters above will cause fetchmail to grab all mail, with verbose data 
passed back, as a daemon process, at 600 second intervals, and will write the 
results to the fetchmail log file.
Create a link on your desktop to the following two files:
fetchmail.log and maillog
I highly recommend testing the process above by doing the following:
Send yourself a test message with localhost specified as the SMTP host. Check 
the maillog file and be sure it was sent and received by the remote mail 
server to which you sent it.  Then, after being sure that the account to 
which you sent it is configured in .fetchmailrc, execute fetchmail without 
any special parameters from the command line. You shouldn't see any errors. 
You may encounter an error with respect to the file permissions when you try 
to execute it. If so, set permissions on fetchmail as necessary. Now, 
navigate to /var/spool/mail, and you should see a file that represents mail 
for root (and any other users you may have). If the root file contains your 
test message (can be read with a text editor), your test was successful!  
Check the fetchmail.log to verify there were no errors in the fetchmail 
process. Now, set up Kmail as follows to grab your mail from the root mailbox 
and have it filtered as necessary:
Setup a "local" type receiving account in Kmail. The path will be:
/var/spool/mail/root and the "locking method" will be 'FNCTL'. You can of 
course set Kmail to poll the root mailbox as often as you like, but it's 
fetchmail that's actually polling your remote mail.

The filter setup is as follows:

<X-Spam-Flag> <equals> <YES>

The actions of this filter will be to mark the status as read, and move the 
mail to a folder of your choice, such as Spam Trap. 

That's it!  If all works well, your mail will be retrieved from remote POP 
servers, passed through SpamAssassin, picked up by Kmail, and be filtered 
accordingly, based on the presence of the SpamAssassin header info.

<p>As per that email, the first thing I did was discover that RedHat's installer
had conveniently installed the FetchMail RPM on my system:</p>
<tt>bash$ rpm -q fetchmail<br>
fetchmail-5.9.0-21</tt>
<p>SpamAssassin hadn't been installed, but the package (and the packages upon which
it depended) were all found on disc 3 of the free download of the RedHat 8.0 distro.</p>

<a class="h3" name="setupfm" href="#toc">Setting up FetchMail</a>
<p><b>...to use SpamAssassin.</b> FetchMail, apparently, applies the same filtering
mechanism as does procmail, so following Mark's instructions, I created the file
<tt>/root/.procmailrc</tt> with these contents:</p>
<pre>:0fw
| /usr/bin/spamassassin</pre>
<p>I needed SpamAssassin running in order to do my various tests, so I started it
with the command '<tt>service spamassassin start</tt>'.</p>
<p><b>...to grab my email.</b> FetchMail needs its own configuration file to know
which mail to actually grab, and where to put it.  Mark's instructions had it dumping
all my mail in <tt>root</tt>'s mail file.  That would mean I'd have to be root to read
it.  I'm no newbie, but I'm not comfortable with that; the less I do as <tt>root</tt>,
the less chance I have of hosing my system.  So once I had it going the way Mark
described, I skimmed the <tt>fetchmail(1)</tt> man page, and found what I wanted.
Thusly, the following (more or less) became my <tt>/root/.fetchmailrc</tt>:</p>
<pre>poll mail.server1.com with protocol pop3
user email1.username is linuxusername, with password your.email.password
poll mail.server2.com with protocol pop3
user email2.username is linuxusername, with password your.email.password</pre>
<p>That file needs 0600 access permissions, or else fetchmail won't work.
With that file in place, I was able to just type '<tt>fetchmail</tt>' as root,
and all the email waiting in both mailboxes were pulled off and moved to my
user account's mail file (in my case, <tt>/var/spool/mail/smiley</tt> since
<tt>smiley</tt> is my 'normal' username).</p>

<a class="h3" name="setupmoz" href="#toc">Mozilla reading Unix mail</a>
<p>With my mail going to my Linux mail file, the quickest way to read it was with the
<tt>mail(1)</tt> program.  I was able to see all the mail headers, and could tell
that SpamAssassin had scanned my mail.  But what I really wanted was to be able to
read it in Mozilla.  So I Googled around a bit, and found a few useful pages:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/movemail/">Movemail support
in Mozilla</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wp.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/relnotes/demo/movemail.html">Unix
mail support in Netscape</a></li></ul>
<p>Between those two, I learned how to achieve what I wanted.  Here's what I did.</p>
<ul><li>First, I created a new mail account in Mozilla to hold my Unix mail.
I called it 'Movemail', and said it was a POP3 account with host 'localhost'.</li>
<li>I exited out of Mozilla, and edited my
<tt>~/.mozilla/default/aeiou.slt/prefs.js</tt> file.  It had a few lines
that looked something like this:<br>
<pre>user_pref("mail.server.server5.hostname", "localhost");
user_pref("mail.server.server5.name", "Movemail");
user_pref("mail.server.server5.type", "pop3");</pre>
I just changed the last line to this:<br>
<pre>user_pref("mail.server.server5.type", "movemail");</pre>
Once I did that and restarted Mozilla, I verified in the account's
Server Settings window that the new account was now of type "Unix Movemail".</li>
<li>I wasn't yet able to access my mail, because of the permissions on the
<tt>/var/spool/mail</tt> directory.  I had to set the "sticky" bit in the directory's
permissions.  I did this (as root) with the command<br>
<pre>chmod 01777 /var/spool/mail</pre>
Being "sticky" means that any user can create a file in that directory, but only
a file's owner can read or delete it.  Once I did that, Mozilla was able to read my
mail, just like in the good old days.</li></ul>

<a class="h3" name="ipupdown" href="#toc">Checking for Mail</a>
<p>FetchMail can be run as a daemon to check mailboxes at regular intervals.
I could have just added a call to '<tt>/usr/bin/fetchmail -d 600</tt>' to one
of my startup scripts, and it would automatically check my mail every 600 seconds.
But I'm a picky guy.  I don't want fetchmail or SpamAssassin running when I don't need
them (basically, any time I'm not online).  I've had past experience with executing
commands when a dial-up link comes up or goes down, so I knew that what I wanted
could be accomplished with the files <tt>/etc/ppp/ip-up.local</tt> and
<tt>ip-down.local</tt>.
If you want more information on what they do, you should have a look at
<tt>/usr/share/doc/ppp-?.?.?/sample/ip-up</tt>.</p>
<p>Here's what I ended up doing.  Here's my <tt>/etc/ppp/ip-up.local</tt>:</p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
#
# This script is run by the pppd after the link is established.
# It should be used to add routes, set IP address, run the mailq
# etc.
#
# This script is called with the following arguments:
#    Arg  Name               Example
#    $1   Interface name     ppp0
#    $2   The tty            ttyS1
#    $3   The link speed     38400
#    $4   Local IP number    12.34.56.78
#    $5   Peer  IP number    12.34.56.99
#

HOME=/root
if [ $1 == ppp0 ] ; then
    service spamassassin start
    /usr/bin/fetchmail -a -d 600
fi</pre>
<p>And here's my <tt>ip-down.local</tt>:</p>
<pre>#!/bin/bash
#
# This script is run by the pppd _after_ the link is brought down.
# It should be used to delete routes, unset IP addresses etc.
#
# This script is called with the following arguments:
#    Arg  Name               Example
#    $1   Interface name     ppp0
#    $2   The tty            ttyS1
#    $3   The link speed     38400
#    $4   Local IP number    12.34.56.78
#    $5   Peer  IP number    12.34.56.99
#

if [ $1 == ppp0 ]; then
    killall fetchmail
    service spamassassin stop
fi</pre>
<a class="h3" name="filter" href="#toc">Filtering out Spam</a>
<p>SpamAssassin doesn't actually kill spam it finds, it just flags it for you.
You still have to tell Mozilla to filter out the stuff SpamAssassin flags.
Fortunately, that's really simple.  In Mozilla Mail, I went to Tools | Message Filters,
and selected the Movemail account I had made in the dropdown at the top.  Then
I added one simple filter.</p>
<img src="http://tagzilla.mozdev.org/spamfilter.png" width="591" height="364"><br>
<p>I had to use the "Customize..." option in the dropdown to create an entry for
the X-Spam-Flag header.</p>
<p>I then tweaked a few of SpamAssassin's settings.  I had to this by editing
<tt>/root/.spamassassin/user_prefs</tt>.  Don't forget that fetchmail and SpamAssassin
are running as daemons, which run as user <tt>root</tt>!  That's why I couldn't get
the filtering I wanted by editing <tt>smiley</tt>'s config file.</p>
<hr>
<p>And that's it!  All done.  I hope that was as educational for you as it was for me.</p>
