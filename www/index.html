<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<h3>What is TagZilla?</h3>
<p>TagZilla is an add-on to Mozilla that lets you add a tagline, random or
specifically chosen by you, to the end of an email or newsgroup posting, or to
the clipboard for pasting into a Web-based email or message board.</p>

<h3>What is a tagline?</h3>
<p>A tagline is a one-line joke, witticism, factoid, what have you.  It can be
about any subject (although it's good to ensure it's appropriate to the forum
in question).  The random quotes that can be found at the end of web pages like
<a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> or <a href="http://mozdev.org">the MozDev
home page</a> could be considered taglines.</p>

<h3>Why did I make TagZilla?</h3>
<p>Back in the early '90s, before the internet was in every home, I got involved
in the <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/BBS.html">BBS</a>
scene.  In particular, I became a regular poster on
the WildNet message network.  Most messages on WildNet, like pretty much every
BBS message network, had taglines tacked onto the end.  But taglines were more than
just simple witticisms; they were a phenomenon.  It was a huge 'game' to try and
create, steal, and collect the most, or the best, taglines.  I wanted to bring
some of the magic of taglines into the Internet era, however belated.</p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I am <a href="mailto:d.perry@utoronto.ca">David Perry</a>. 
I earned my Computer Engineering degree (and my
<a href="http://ironring.ca">Iron Ring</a>) from the
<a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>.  I live in
Ontario, Canada, and I'm currently looking for a career.  If you need a
Computer Engineer, programmer, or IT guy, drop me a line. (:</p>

<p>TagZilla is my first time starting a Mozilla project, but it isn't my first
time participating in one.  I've done a lot of work for
<a href="http://multizilla.mozdev.org">MultiZilla</a>, and I've also done some
work for <a href="http://optimoz.mozdev.org/gestures">MozGest</a>.  Outside
of Mozilla, I diddle around with an occasional project here and there, just to
see how it works. (:</p>
