<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<h3>TagZilla 0.052 released</h3>
<p>
After over a year, TagZilla has <i>finally</i> been updated!
</p>
<ul>
<li>One xpi, three platforms: supports
<a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla Suite</a>,
<a href="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/">Firefox</a> and
<a href="http://mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>
</li>
<li>Supports Firefox 0.9 and Thunderbird 0.7's <a href="http://www.bengoodger.com/software/mb/extensions/packaging/extensions.html">new installer format</a></li>
<li>Automated uninstall button (requires suitably recent version of JSLib)</li>
<li>Several bugfixes, hopefully tagline insertion won't be so broken now</li>
<li>Ability to select the character set used in your tagline files</li>
<li>Seems to work with <a href="http://enigmail.mozdev.org">EnigMail</a>
(On my computer, anyway; your mileage may vary!
Install EnigMail <i>before</i> TagZilla for best results)</li>
</ul>
Known bugs/issues:
<ul>
<li>Despite being over a year in coming, this release was still "rushed".
(That's the downside to being gainfully employed.)
You may encounter strange behaviour.  If you do, email me or file a bug.</li>
<li>In Firefox 0.9+ and Thunderbird 0.7+, you <b style="font-size:larger">absolutely positively
<u style="font-size:larger">MUST</u></b> install
<a href="http://jslib.mozdev.org/installation.html">JSLib</a>
<b style="font-size:larger">BEFORE</b> you install TagZilla!  Otherwise, the program won't appear
to start once you install TagZilla.  If you get yourself stuck like this,
here's how to recover:
    <ol>
    <li>Ensure the program isn't running at all (check your process list,
        however your host OS makes you do that, to be sure)</li>
    <li>Run the program in Safe Mode (there's a shortcut in Windows, or
        use the <code>--safe-mode</code> option on the command line)</li>
    <li>Either install JSLib now, or uninstall TagZilla</li>
    <li>Exit the program and restart it normally</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>In Firefox and Thunderbird, the character set selector in the Preferences
window will show up as empty the first time
(<a href="http://mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=2098">Bug 2098</a>).
Your setting was indeed saved and will be used.  Workaround: close
and reopen the preferences window.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is TagZilla?</h3>
<p>TagZilla is an add-on to Mozilla that lets you add a tagline, random or
specifically chosen by you, to the end of an email or newsgroup posting, or to
the clipboard for pasting into a Web-based email or message board.</p>

<h3>What is a tagline?</h3>
<p>A tagline is a one-line joke, witticism, factoid, what have you.  It can be
about any subject (although it's good to ensure it's appropriate to the forum
in question).  The random quotes that can be found at the end of web pages like
<a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> or <a href="http://mozdev.org">the MozDev
home page</a> could be considered taglines.</p>

<h3>Why did I make TagZilla?</h3>
<p>Back in the early '90s, before the internet was in every home, I got involved
in the <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/BBS.html">BBS</a>
scene.  In particular, I became a regular poster on
the WildNet message network.  Most messages on WildNet, like pretty much every
BBS message network, had taglines tacked onto the end.  But taglines were more than
just simple witticisms; they were a phenomenon.  It was a huge 'game' to try and
create, steal, and collect the most, or the best, taglines.  I wanted to bring
some of the magic of taglines into the Internet era, however belated.</p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I am <a href="mailto:d.perry@utoronto.ca">David Perry</a>. 
I earned my Computer Engineering degree (and my
<a href="http://ironring.ca">Iron Ring</a>) from the
<a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>.  ERTW.  I live in
Ontario, Canada.</p>

<p>TagZilla is my first time starting a Mozilla project, but it isn't my first
time participating in one.  I've done a lot of work for
<a href="http://multizilla.mozdev.org">MultiZilla</a>, and I've also done some
work for <a href="http://optimoz.mozdev.org/gestures">MozGest</a>.  Outside
of Mozilla, I diddle around with an occasional project here and there, just to
see how it works. (:</p>
