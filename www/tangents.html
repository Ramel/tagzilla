<p>On occasion, I've been known to go off on an informative but not-always-relevant
tangent.  This page is a starting-point for any Mozilla-related tangents that have

no other place to put it.  So here you go.  Enjoy.  Or don't.</p>

have to be that way.  I figured out how to get all the ninja goodness of
<a href="http://spamassassin.org/">SpamAssassin</a> to mix with the UI candy of the
Mozilla Mail client.  Look up if you want to see what I did.</p>
