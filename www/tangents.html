<h3 class="page-header">Tangents</h3>

<p>On occasion, I've been known to go off on an informative but not-always-relevant
tangent.  This page is a starting-point for any Mozilla-related tangents that have
come to my mind, that I think other people might like to know, and that I know of
no other place to put it.  So here you go.  Enjoy.  Or don't.</p>

<a class="h3" href="mozilla-spamassassin-HOWDID.html">Mozilla-SpamAssassin-HOWDID</a><br />
<p>Spam and email seem to go hand-in-hand like taglines and email.  But it doesn't
have to be that way.  I figured out how to get all the ninja goodness of
<a href="http://spamassassin.org/">SpamAssassin</a> to mix with the UI candy of the
Mozilla Mail client.  Look up if you want to see what I did.</p>

<a class="h3" href="tbstyle.html">Toolbar Style Menu</a><br />
<p>A web page designer can add many optional styles to a web page, and Mozilla will
let you choose among them.  That is, if you're able to guess that there's more than
one style available for a page, since Mozilla hides the ability to do so behind two
submenus.  I whipped up a quick-and-dirty menu that appears right on the link toolbar
to tell me when there's other styles.  And it can tell you, too.</p>
